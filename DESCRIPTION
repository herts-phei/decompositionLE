Description: The goal of decompositionLE is to provide an easy to use implementation of life expectancy decomposition formulas for age bands, derived from Ponnapalli, K. (2005). A comparison of different methods for decomposition of changes in expectation of life at birth and differentials in life expectancy at birth. Demographic Research, 12, pp.141–172. doi: https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2005.12.7. In addition, there is a decomposition function for disease cause breakdown, as well as some useful helper plot functions.
