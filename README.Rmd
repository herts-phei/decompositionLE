The goal of **decompositionLE** is to provide an easy to use implementation of life expectancy decomposition formulas for age bands, derived from *Ponnapalli, K. (2005). A comparison of different methods for decomposition of changes in expectation of life at birth and differentials in life expectancy at birth. Demographic Research, 12, pp.141â€“172. doi: https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2005.12.7.* In addition, there is a decomposition function for disease cause breakdown, as well as some useful helper plot functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of decompositionLE from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("herts-phei/decompositionLE")
```

## Example

The package contains a built-in dataset, of life table values for US women born in 1935 and 1995, also sourced from *Ponnapalli, K. (2005).*
